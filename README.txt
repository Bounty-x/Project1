Graph is also in the running time.png file

The results.txt will be wiped and recalculated everytime Test.java is ran.
Each algorithm uses a same copy of 10 test lists from 50,000 to 500,000 items in increments of +50,000 (random) items

All space used for each algorithm is constant except for Merge Sort which is linear space


Part2

speed: O(nlogn)

startInsert is the variable used around line 18 which decides when we move to our
quadratic sort.

space: O(constant)
